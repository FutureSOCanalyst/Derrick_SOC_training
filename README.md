# 🛡️ Derrick Wilson's SOC Analyst Training Lab

Welcome! This is my personal cybersecurity analyst lab, built to document and demonstrate my hands-on journey to becoming a SOC Analyst. I'm currently a high school senior pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a focus in cybersecurity.

This repo contains real log analysis, alert triage, incident simulations, and SOC-style playbooks — all based on real tools and Linux environments.

## 💡 About Me

I’m Derrick — a 17-year-old high school senior from Memphis focused on cybersecurity. I learn best by doing hands-on labs. I’ve built and broken VMs, practiced alert triage, and recreated attacker behavior in logs. I currently hold the CompTIA ITF+ certification and I’m working my way toward becoming a professional SOC Analyst.

## 🛠️ Tools I Use

- Kali Linux
- `journalctl`, `grep`, `less`, `tail`
- Wireshark & Nmap
- VirtualBox (for building lab environments)
- Hydra (for safe brute-force simulation)
